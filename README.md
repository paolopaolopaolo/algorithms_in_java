# Textbook Algorithms Written In Java

The high-level algorithms represented in this repository were all implemented independently 
by myself using guidance from the many resources on algorithms from the internet. Each file
credits the appropriate contributors, detailing exactly what each contributor brought to the
table.

To compile any of these programs will require that you have JUnit-4.12.jar in your classpath.
Visit their website (Junit.org) to download the appropriate files!

### Reasons for making this repository
1. Documenting progress in understanding concepts that are key to understanding algorithms
..* Rather than write a protracted blog about what I've picked up from various sources, I'll show by doing. 
Each file will not only document my progress in understanding how to implement these algorithms, but also
give me ample practice in documenting my work. 

2. Keeping on hand a useful codebase of algorithms I can use for various projects
..* Sure, I can pull them from other sources but why not just use the fruits of my labor? :p

3. Practice using Version Control
..* The most important thing this exercise can help me with is more practice in managing a pristine and
well maintained Git repository.
